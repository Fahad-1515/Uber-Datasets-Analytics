# Uber-Datasets-Analytics 2024



## Project Goal

Uber Ride Cancellation Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

To identify patterns and root causes behind ride cancellations to help Uber reduce their frequency and improve operational efficiency.

## Data Source

Uber Dataset from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdevladdha/uber-ride-analytics-dashboard/data

## Tools

MS SQL Server / Excel / python

## Objectives

● Clean the ride bookings dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors in
records related to cancellations.

● Standardize data formats and representations for uniformity.

● Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover the root causes, patterns, and trends
behind ride cancellations.

● Derive actionable insights to help Uber reduce cancellation rates, improve driver-rider
matching, and enhance overall platform efficiency.

## Data Analysis

● What is the overall cancellation rate, and what is the split between driver and rider
cancellations?

● How does the cancellation rate vary by time?

● By Month/Season: Are there seasonal trends (e.g., more cancellations in rainy season)?

● Are there geographical patterns to cancellations?

● Which specific reasons are most commonly cited for cancellations?

## Future Scope

● Use the dataset to analyze the impact of policy changes, such as introducing a cancellation fee
or a new driver incentive program.

● Analyze the impact of cancellation chains (e.g., a driver cancelling leading to a rider cancelling
another ride).

## Conclusion

● Interactive Dashboard can be Develop for real-time dashboard for operations managers to
monitor cancellation hotspots and trends as they happen, enabling proactive measures.

## Booking Status

● Most rides are completed, but there's a significant number of cancellations by both drivers and customers.

## Vehicle Types: 

● Go Mini and Auto are the most commonly used vehicle types for completed rides.

## Cancellation Reasons:

● Customers mostly cancel because "Driver is not moving towards pickup location"

● Drivers mostly cancel due to "Customer related issues" and "Personal & Car related issues"

## Temporal Patterns

● Peak booking hours are in the evening (around 6 PM)

● Weekdays see more bookings than weekends

## Payment Methods 

● UPI is the most popular payment method, followed by Cash.

## Pricing

● There's a strong positive correlation between ride distance and booking value.
