Project Goal

Uber Ride Cancellation Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview

To identify patterns and root causes behind ride cancellations to help Uber reduce their frequency and improve operational efficiency.

Data Source

Uber Dataset from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdevladdha/uber-ride-analytics-dashboard/data

Tools

MS SQL Server

Objectives

● Clean the ride bookings dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors in
records related to cancellations.

● Standardize data formats and representations for uniformity.

● Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover the root causes, patterns, and trends
behind ride cancellations.

● Derive actionable insights to help Uber reduce cancellation rates, improve driver-rider
matching, and enhance overall platform efficiency.

Data Analysis

● What is the overall cancellation rate, and what is the split between driver and rider
cancellations?

● How does the cancellation rate vary by time?

By Hour of Day: Is it higher during rush hour, late nights, or specific times?

By Day of Week: Are weekends different from weekdays?

By Month/Season: Are there seasonal trends (e.g., more cancellations in rainy season)?

● Are there geographical patterns to cancellations?

● Which specific reasons are most commonly cited for cancellations?

● Is there a correlation between the estimated fare and cancellation rate?

Future Scope

● Use the dataset to analyze the impact of policy changes, such as introducing a cancellation fee
or a new driver incentive program.

● Analyze the impact of cancellation chains (e.g., a driver cancelling leading to a rider cancelling
another ride).
Conclusion

● Interactive Dashboard can be Develop for real-time dashboard for operations managers to
monitor cancellation hotspots and trends as they happen, enabling proactive measures.

● By rigorously cleaning the data and addressing inconsistencies, this project provides a reliable
foundation for analysis. The insights derived—such as pinpointing high-cancellation hours,
locations, and the critical impact of ETA offer a clear roadmap for strategic decision-making.
Implementing data-driven solutions based on these findings can directly lead to reduced
operational inefficiencies, increased driver and rider satisfaction, and higher revenue retention
for the platform.
